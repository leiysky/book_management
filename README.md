# Book_management
A simple bookstore manage system server based on Node.js and MySQL.

# Usage
Run:
```shell
$ npm install
```
to install the server.

Run:
```shell
$ npm run test
```
to run server.

Use the `SQL/Dump20180701.sql` to create schema and tables. And you'd better run it with MySQL 8.0.

# Configure
You should configure your db by editing the `src/utils/db.js`.

And you can read Swagger API docs in `docs/`.
